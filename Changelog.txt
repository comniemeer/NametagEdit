v3.0

@sgtcaze
[Fixes]
- Resolved command argument issues that said "An internal error..."

[Improvements]
- Deleted PlayerLoader/GroupLoader, replace with NTEHandler
- Deleted NametagUtils class, as most of the functions were for the PlayerLoader/GroupLoader classes
- Deleted NametagHooKGM and NametagHookPEX because they are redundant, and support would
never end (i.e. what about bPermissions, zPermissions, YAPP, BukkitPerms, SuperPerms etc.)
- General cleanup, removed unused methods, switch to dependency injection for some classes
rather than using static objects/variables
- Rewrote command class to be less redundant, easier to read, and have more features
- Deleted the updater class because of version conflicts with dev builds
- Deleted NameFetcher class because we don't use it anymore
- Edited pom.xml to reflect no more optional dependencies

- getOnlinePlayers() work around
