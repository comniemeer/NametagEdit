= NametagEdit

== Description
NametagEdit is an easy to configure plugin that allows users to change their nametags and tab names. With NametagEdit, users can add an additional 16 characters before and after their name.

== Example Command Usage

=== Editing Invidiual Prefixes/Suffixes
Suppose we wish to have a nametag like

{{{
[Admin] sgtcazeyt
}}}

The command would be:

{{{
/nte prefix sgtcazeyt '[Admin] '
}}}

The ' ' characters will be automatically removed, and allow you to use spaces

=== Creating/Editing Group Properties
So we want to create, or edit a group. We can start by creating it:
First, we'll use: /ne groups add MyGroup
Second, we need to set the permission: /ne groups set perm MyGroup my.custom.permission
Next, we'll need to set the prefix: /ne groups set prefix MyGroup "&a[MyGroup] &e"
Finally, we'll set the suffix: /ne groups set suffix MyGroup " &cMy Suffix"

== Permissions

| nametagedit.use | Allows a player to use the NametagEdit plugin |
| nametagedit.reload | Allows a user to reload the plugin's data |
| nametagedit.clear.others | Allows a player to clear ANYONE's prefix/suffix |
| nametagedit.clear.self | Allows a player to only clear their own prefix/suffix |
| nametagedit.edit.others | Allows a player to edit ANYONE's prefix/suffix |

== FlatFile and MySQL 
Currently there are two options for storing group/player data. They are "flatfile" and "mysql". Flatfile is practical for small servers that only intend
to run specific configurations. For larger servers that require tags be consistent through, let's say a network, MySQL easily manages access from multiple locations

If you choose FlatFile support, all your edits will be accessible via the players.yml and groups.yml files. 

If you choose MySQL support, all edits must be made via the API or in game commands. NametagEdit requires a database for MySQL support. Once initiated, NametagEdit
will establish a connection automatically, and generate the necessary tables for you if they do not exist. If you use a mysql web editor, such as PhpMyAdmin, you
can easily (and directly) modify NametagEdit data as if it were a flat file. Similarly, a the MySQL terminal can be used. 

== Configuration
When the plugin starts for the first time, it will generate 3 configurable files. They are: "config.yml", "groups.yml" and "players.yml".

=== config.yml

| Option  | Value(s)  | Description |
| TabListDisabled | true/false | If enabled, NametagEdit will not alter a user's name in the tab. This can also be overriden with the function setPlayerListName(); |
| MetricsEnabled  | true/false | If 'true', small amounts of data will be sent to MCstats.org so we can keep track of the plugin's popularity. |
| Chat.Enabled | true/false | If 'true', NametagEdit will format the chat with the "Chat.Format" string |
| MySQL | true/false | If 'true', NametagEdit will use MySQL to store group/player data |

=== groups.yml
When arranging your groups.yml, please have the order be ascending. Meaning, have your lowest group at the top (let's say default) and your highest group (let's say owner) at the bottom.

{{{
Groups:
  Moderator: # This is the 'key' or the thing to distinguish this group
     Permission: nte.moderator # This is the permission required to have this nametag - it can be anything
     Prefix: '&2' # Both Prefix/Suffix are REQUIRED, even if they are blank. String length will be automatically appended 
     Suffix: '&f'
}}}

=== players.yml

{{{
Players:
  b5ccebaa-0623-4370-af73-0ec985dfa3b0: # This is the 'key' to identify the players
     Name: sgtcazeyt # This is the friendly name of the player
     Prefix: '&b' # Both Prefix/Suffix are REQUIRED, even if they are blank. String length will be automatically appended
     Suffix: '&c'
}}}

== FAQ

**Will NametagEdit allow me to change my skin/name?**

No, NametagEdit only builds on your current name.

**Why should I use this plugin?**

NametagEdit is a standalone plugin that is compatible with many versions. It is a great donation feature, and adds a unique look to your server.

**My client crashes with the reason "Cannot remove from NTE #". Why is this?**

Due to how scoreboards were implemented in Minecraft, a player cannot belong to two teams. Any two scoreboard plugins, whether through packets
or the bukkit scoreboard api - which are basically the same thing, that alter team prefixes/suffixes, will have conflicts. There is currently no way around this.

**My prefixes/suffixes are incorrect. What's wrong?**

This is likely to due to the structure of your permissions. Please ensure the correct groups inherit the correct permissions.
